I am 4th year software engineering student that will be graduating this summer. I have plenty of experience 
with Java as I have done many projects for school using Java. I am experienced in developing web applications 
as I have built various web applications during my co-op work terms. I have good verbal and written communication 
skills as I have written formal reports and given presentations about my team project for my communication class. 
I have great teamworking skills as all my team projects were successful. You can learn more about my experience
in my [resume](/resume.pdf).
